# Assignment 6: Medians and Order Statistics & Elementary Data Structures

## Overview
This repository contains implementations and analyses of selection algorithms (both deterministic and randomized) as well as basic data structures including arrays, stacks, queues, and linked lists. The purpose of this assignment is to deepen the understanding of medians, order statistics, and the performance characteristics of these data structures.

## Contents
- **Selection Algorithms**:
  - `Deterministic.py`: Implementation of the deterministic selection algorithm (Median of Medians).
  - `Empirical.py`: Implementation of the randomized selection algorithm (Randomized Quickselect).
- **Elementary Data Structures**:
 
  - `stacks.py`: Implementation of stack
